## How it works

Cockatoo Edge consumes a public database published by Cockatoo Core (a proprietary, real-time ML-powered component of the Cockatoo family) to identify and mitigate known threats. 

The Edge deployment minimizes computational overhead and improves reaction times by handling decisions locally.
