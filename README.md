> Work in progress â€” NOT production ready.

[![GHCR Docker Build](https://github.com/DominicTWHV/Cockatoo_Edge/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DominicTWHV/Cockatoo_Edge/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml)

**Deployment:**

```bash
N/A
```

## How it works

Cockatoo Edge consumes a public database published by Cockatoo Core (a proprietary, real-time ML-powered component of the Cockatoo family) to identify and mitigate known threats. 

The Edge deployment minimizes computational overhead and improves reaction times by handling decisions locally.
